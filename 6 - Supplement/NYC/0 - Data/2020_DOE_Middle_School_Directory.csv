The school prepares students for professional music careers while recognizing that not every student will choose such a career. The underlying philosophy of the Special Music School is the belief that music education for gifted pupils requires: 1) extensive opportunities to work one-to-one with an outstanding instrumental faculty; 2) a structured, sequential music curriculum; 3) opportunities to perform before audiences; and 4) interaction between general academics and musical studies. Our goal is to see each child reach his or her academic and musical potential.

19,19K907,Legacy School of the Arts (19K907),"M.S. 907 opened its doors in Fall 2018. Imagine a place where your child's creativity is tapped, their intellect is nurtured, their artistic talents are sharpened, and they are supported and happy. Welcome to M.S. 907 - a place for students to discover who they were meant to be! Our school combines standards-based academic instruction, exposure to the arts, and a projects-based approach to educate our students. And for those who exhibit exceptional academic or artistic aptitude, our Gifted and Talented program will challenge them so they can excel. Our model relies on student choice and exposure. Each semester sixth and seventh grade students will choose an arts elective (music, visual arts, creative writing, theater, and dance) to explore their skillsets. In their eighth grade year, students may narrow their focus to one specific arts connection to supplement their academics as they prepare for high school, college, and professional careers. Daily academic experiences will also be enriched for all students by authentic curricular connections to the arts. Picture it! As part of their creative arts or music elective, your child can learn to write poetry or songs to show the experiences of those they learn about in their humanities classes. Or, during dance elective, they can choreograph a jazz piece using their newfound math knowledge. As students grow at M.S. 907, they will build positive and enduring relationships with each other and the adults around them and develop their sense of self. They will also practice critical life skills such as persistence, flexible thinking, and innovation, habits of mind which will prepare them to be productive citizens in a 21st century global community.

32,32K384,P.S. /I.S. 384 Frances E. Carter (32K384),"Students at PS/IS 384 often say that the school feels like a part of their family. As a 3K - 8th grade school, many students have spent nine years or more in our building, and have truly become part of our family. Our school is a place where all students are held to high expectations, and are pushed to be the best they can be. Our students understand that hard work always pays off, and we ensure that all students are challenged. We have a Dual Language program so that students can become fluent in both Spanish and English.  We are a ""Kids at Hope"" school, a place in which all teachers, staff and community members believe that all children can achieve success, no exceptions. In a caring, warm school environment, our students are comfortable taking risks. Our students go on many wonderful trips around NYC to visit the Statue of Liberty, attend a Major League Baseball game, or take a walking tour of Chinatown. Many of our classrooms are filled with interesting class pets so our students can learn about caring for animals. At PS/IS 384 we want our parents to feel supported, so the school has an open door policy, and parents are welcome to come in and speak with the principal or teachers at any time.",Bushwick,"242 COOPER STREET, BROOKLYN NY 11207",0,Partially Accessible,718-642-4890,,L to Wilson Ave,"B20, B26",K384E,P.S. /I.S. 384 Frances E.
